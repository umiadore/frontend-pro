                    Hi, everyone! Ive always been fond of art but studied International
                    Relations, and I currently work in Marketing. In addition, I love
                    learning languages. So far, I speak four fluently. Java and JavaScript
                    are in progress, as is Arabic. Life is a journey, lets see where ill
                    land tomorrow. Yalla! üåè
